I would firstly like to thank my supervisor, David Lester, for the useful feedback and motivation during the development of my project. Massive gratitude goes also to Alan Bary Stokes, who became a second supervisor to me, always raising interesting insights and introducing me to the SpiNNaker lifestyle, alongside Andrew Rowley and Thomas Heinis.

As always, friends and family will always be in my heart. I love you all, Captain Leifoot, Canny Dattlin, Kosta Pinapple, Veni Jalape√±o, JsPine, Bae, Nij For Speed, Ctrl C + Ctrl Virr, gym buddies, Dodgeball crew, mum, dad, bro, Toddy \& Guto (my dogs), and anyone else I forgot to mention.
