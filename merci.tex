I would firstly like to thank my supervisor, David Lester and Ning Zhang for the useful feedback and motivation during the development of my project. Massive gratitude goes also to Alan Stokes, who became a second supervisor to me, always raising interesting insights and introducing me to the SpiNNaker lifestyle, alongside Andrew Rowley. As always, friends and family will always be in my heart.

I love you all.
