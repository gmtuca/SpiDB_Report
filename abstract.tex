A Database Management System (DBMS) is a suite of programs which manage large structured sets of persistent data.\cite{dbmsdef} Thus it performs the organization, storage, security and integrity of the user's data.

This report contains details of an approach for implementing a DBMS, namely SpiDB, on the Spiking Neural Network Architecture (SpiNNaker), an emerging, highly distributed hardware design optimised for Neural Network simulations.[reference?] The open-source project covers different implementations of a Key-value store and a Relational DBMS under the architecture constraints.

As a research project, it has a strong focus on the evaluation of results, which allows exploration of how the SpiNNaker hardware performs under a non-neuromorphic environment. The conclusions gathered show limitations and strengths of the architecture under this general purpose application, with suggestions on possible modifications. This can serve as feedback for improvements on the ongoing SpiNNaker development.
